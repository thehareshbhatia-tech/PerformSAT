/**
 * dayNarrative.js — one short, plain-language coach line for a single day in
 * the Weekly View, rendered above that day's activity cards.
 *
 * Echoes Acely's per-day narrative: explain WHY this focus lands today, give
 * one concrete watch-for, and fold in a test-proximity nudge. Two sentences at
 * most. Plain text — no emoji, not italic (the study plan is where advice
 * belongs, per the diagnostic-vs-plan split).
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: a function of the day's activities, the section-
 * tagged weaknesses (read for accuracy/"why"), and days-until-test. No
 * Firestore, no network, no AI. Returns '' when there's nothing to say (an
 * empty or fully-skipped day) so the caller can omit the line entirely.
