/**
 * diagnosisNuances — the "but here's the catch" layer on top of a score band.
 *
 * A band and a target on their own can mislead: a student whose whole range
 * clears their goal sees "100 above target" and a full progress bar, when the
 * honest read is "your goal is too low to shape a plan." This selector turns
 * those situations into short, specific advice with a real next action
 * (raise the target, fix a past test date, take a full test), so the
 * diagnosis screen and the home card say the nuanced thing instead of the
 * hollow one.
 *
 * Pure: everything is computed from the inputs at RENDER time (never
 * persisted), so the advice tracks the student's current target and date.
 *
 * Use it wherever a band/score is shown next to a goal: MiniDiagnosticResults
 * ("Worth knowing"), the home score hero (one line, highest priority only).
