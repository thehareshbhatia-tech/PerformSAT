/**
 * planFormatUpgrade.js — plan format versioning + the drill-shaped activity
 * builder shared by the generator (new plans) and the read-time upgrade of
 * persisted plans (legacy plans).
 *
 * ZERO corpus imports by design: useProgress (main chunk) runs the upgrade on
 * hydration, so this module may only depend on pure-constant taxonomy files
 * (bundleGuard). The generator imports buildSkillDrillActivity from here so
 * generated and upgraded activities share one shape.
 *
 * Format history:
 *   1 (implicit) — weeks[].activities only contained math module/section
 *       practice + strategy/review/test items. R&W gaps and math gaps that
 *       missed the hand-authored module map emitted NOTHING ("targeted
 *       practice" weeks could be entirely empty).
 *   2 — drill-shaped activities (skillId + section, no moduleId) cover both
 *       sections; upgradeLegacyPlanWeeks backfills them into persisted plans
 *       from plan.weaknesses. (Dev-only stamp, never shipped.)
 *   3 — also heals the cross-scale "past your target" headline on upgraded
 *       plans. (Dev-only stamp, never shipped.)
 *   4 — backfilled activities carry a `day` assignment (getTodaySlice
 *       surfaces activities by day name; day-less additions existed only in
 *       the Weekly View). Re-running on a v2/v3 plan assigns days to any
 *       existing day-less augmented activities in place — positions never
 *       move, so completion indexes stay valid.
