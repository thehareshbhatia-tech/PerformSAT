      question: "A bookshelf is $7.5$ feet tall. Given that $1$ foot is equal to $12$ inches, what is the height of the bookshelf, in inches?",
      choices: [
        { id: "A", text: "$0.625$" },
        { id: "B", text: "$19.5$" },
        { id: "C", text: "$84$" },
        { id: "D", text: "$90$" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "D",
      hint: "An inch is smaller than a foot, so the number of inches must come out larger than the number of feet.",
      explanation: "**Choice D is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~10s):** $7.5(12)=90$ inches — choice D.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Set up the conversion so the unwanted unit cancels: $7.5\\text{ feet}\\times\\frac{12\\text{ inches}}{1\\text{ foot}}$.\nStep 2: The unit of feet cancels, leaving $7.5(12)=90$ inches.\nStep 3: Check: $7$ feet is $84$ inches and the extra half foot is $6$ inches, so $84+6=90$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($0.625$): divides by $12$ instead of multiplying: $7.5\\div 12=0.625$, which would shrink the measurement rather than expressing it in smaller units.\n* Choice B ($19.5$): adds the conversion factor to the measurement: $7.5+12=19.5$.\n* Choice C ($84$): converts only the whole number of feet, $7(12)=84$, and drops the extra $0.5$ foot.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Write the conversion factor as a fraction and let the unit cancel. Converting to a smaller unit always multiplies, so the count goes up.",

      question: "A conveyor belt carries boxes past a scanner at a constant rate of $2{,}700$ boxes per hour. At this rate, how many boxes pass the scanner per minute?",
      choices: [

        { id: "C", text: "$45$" },
        { id: "D", text: "$162{,}000$" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "C",
      hint: "A minute is a small slice of an hour, so the count per minute must be far smaller than the count per hour.",
      explanation: "**Choice C is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~15s):** There are $60$ minutes in an hour, so $\\frac{2{,}700}{60}=45$ boxes per minute — choice C.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Write the rate as a fraction: $\\frac{2{,}700\\text{ boxes}}{1\\text{ hour}}$.\nStep 2: Multiply by $\\frac{1\\text{ hour}}{60\\text{ minutes}}$ so that hours cancel: $\\frac{2{,}700}{60}$ boxes per minute.\nStep 3: Divide: $\\frac{2{,}700}{60}=45$ boxes per minute. Check: $45(60)=2{,}700$ boxes in one hour. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($0.75$): divides by $3{,}600$, converting all the way to boxes per second instead of boxes per minute.\n* Choice B ($27$): divides by $100$, treating an hour as $100$ minutes.\n* Choice D ($162{,}000$): multiplies by $60$ instead of dividing, which scales the rate up when a shorter time interval must scale it down.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Decide the direction before you compute: a shorter time interval means a smaller count, so the $60$ belongs in the denominator.",

      question: "The table gives the mass, in grams, of each of four mineral samples collected on a field trip. Given that $1$ kilogram is equal to $1{,}000$ grams, what is the total mass of the four samples, in kilograms?",
      diagram: { type: "dataTable", params: { headers: ["Sample", "Mass (grams)"], rows: [["W", "1,250"], ["X", "860"], ["Y", "2,340"], ["Z", "550"]] } },

        { id: "C", text: "$50$" },
        { id: "D", text: "$5{,}000$" }
      ],
      correctAnswer: "B",
      hint: "Combine the four masses in the unit the table uses, then convert the single total once.",
      explanation: "**Choice B is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~25s):** The masses total $5{,}000$ grams, and $\\frac{5{,}000}{1{,}000}=5$ kilograms — choice B.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Add the four masses in grams: $1{,}250+860+2{,}340+550=5{,}000$ grams.\nStep 2: Convert once, at the end: $5{,}000\\text{ grams}\\times\\frac{1\\text{ kilogram}}{1{,}000\\text{ grams}}$.\nStep 3: The grams cancel, leaving $\\frac{5{,}000}{1{,}000}=5$ kilograms. Check: $5$ kilograms is $5(1{,}000)=5{,}000$ grams, the total from step 1. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($0.5$): divides the total by $10{,}000$ rather than $1{,}000$.\n* Choice C ($50$): divides by $100$, as if a kilogram were $100$ grams.\n* Choice D ($5{,}000$): reports the correct total but leaves it in grams, never performing the conversion the question asks for.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Convert once, after the arithmetic, not sample by sample — fewer conversions means fewer places to slip a factor of ten.",

      question: "A pump delivers water at a constant rate of $4$ liters every $5$ seconds. At this rate, how many liters of water does the pump deliver in $45$ minutes?",
      choices: [

      ],
      correctAnswer: "C",
      hint: "The rate is stated in seconds but the time is stated in minutes — reconcile the two units before dividing anything.",
      explanation: "**Choice C is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~30s):** $45$ minutes is $2{,}700$ seconds; that is $\\frac{2{,}700}{5}=540$ five-second intervals, each delivering $4$ liters: $540(4)=2{,}160$ liters — choice C.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Convert the elapsed time to seconds: $45(60)=2{,}700$ seconds.\nStep 2: Count the five-second intervals: $\\frac{2{,}700}{5}=540$ intervals.\nStep 3: Each interval delivers $4$ liters, so the pump delivers $540(4)=2{,}160$ liters.\nStep 4: Check with a unit rate: $\\frac{4}{5}=0.8$ liter per second, and $0.8(2{,}700)=2{,}160$ liters. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($36$): treats the $45$ minutes as $45$ seconds: $\\frac{45}{5}(4)=36$.\n* Choice B ($540$): converts the time correctly but stops at the number of intervals, $\\frac{2{,}700}{5}=540$, without multiplying by the $4$ liters each one delivers.\n* Choice D ($3{,}375$): inverts the rate to $5$ liters every $4$ seconds: $\\frac{2{,}700}{4}(5)=3{,}375$.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Turn a two-number rate into a unit rate when the arithmetic gets crowded: liters per second times seconds is a single multiplication with no intervals to miscount.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: "C",
      hint: "Check any candidate with easy numbers: one bottle per minute for one hour has an answer you already know.",
      explanation: "**Choice C is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~30s):** $h$ hours is $60h$ minutes, and each minute yields $r$ bottles: $60hr$ bottles — choice C.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Convert the operating time to the unit the rate uses: $h\\text{ hours}\\times\\frac{60\\text{ minutes}}{1\\text{ hour}}=60h$ minutes.\nStep 2: Multiply the number of minutes by the number of bottles filled each minute: $(60h)(r)=60rh$ bottles.\nStep 3: Check the units: $\\frac{\\text{bottles}}{\\text{minute}}\\times\\text{minutes}$ leaves bottles, which is what the question asks for.\nStep 4: Check with numbers: at $r=1$ and $h=1$ the machine fills $1$ bottle per minute for $60$ minutes, so $60$ bottles, and $60(1)(1)=60$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($\\frac{rh}{60}$): divides by $60$ instead of multiplying, which would be right only if the rate were per hour and the answer were wanted per minute.\n* Choice B ($\\frac{60h}{r}$): inverts the rate, treating $r$ as minutes per bottle rather than bottles per minute.\n* Choice D ($3{,}600rh$): uses $3{,}600$, the number of seconds in an hour, even though the rate is given per minute.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** With letters instead of numbers, substitute $r=1$ and $h=1$: the arithmetic becomes trivial and only one expression survives.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      hint: "A square yard is a square that is one yard on each side — picture how many one-foot squares fit inside it.",
      explanation: "**Choice C is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~15s):** One square yard holds $3^{2}=9$ square feet, so $15(9)=135$ square feet — choice C.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: A square yard is a $3$-foot by $3$-foot square, so it contains $3(3)=9$ square feet.\nStep 2: The area conversion therefore multiplies by $9$, not by $3$: $15(9)=135$ square feet.\nStep 3: Check with a concrete rug: a $5$-yard by $3$-yard rug has area $15$ square yards, and in feet it is $15$ by $9$, an area of $135$ square feet. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($45$): multiplies by the linear factor $3$ instead of its square.\n* Choice B ($90$): doubles the linear factor, using $2(3)=6$ where squaring is required.\n* Choice D ($405$): cubes the factor, $3^{3}=27$, which converts volumes rather than areas.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Squaring a unit squares its conversion factor. Draw the one-unit square once and the factor of $9$ is obvious rather than memorized.",
