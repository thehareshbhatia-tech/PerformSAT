      explanation: "**Choice B is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~35s):** Dividing the given equation by $2$ gives $3x - 2y = 5$. Keeping those coefficients but changing the constant to $8$ produces a parallel, distinct line.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: A system of two linear equations has no solution exactly when its graphs are parallel and distinct.\nStep 2: Two equations in the form $ax + by = c$ are parallel when their $x$- and $y$-coefficients are proportional. Halving the given equation gives $3x - 2y = 5$, so the second equation must have coefficients proportional to $3$ and $-2$.\nStep 3: The equation $3x - 2y = 8$ has exactly those coefficients but a different constant, so the lines are parallel and distinct and the system has no solution.

The constants differ, so the lines are parallel and distinct and there is no solution. Check: solving the first equation for $y$ and substituting into the second gives $0 = 1$, which is never true. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($\\frac{8}{5}$): inverts the proportion, solving $\\frac{a}{4} = \\frac{6}{15}$.\n* Choice B ($\\frac{5}{2}$): reports the scale factor $\\frac{15}{6}$ itself instead of multiplying it by $4$.\n* Choice D ($13$): adds the difference of the $y$-coefficients, $15 - 6 = 9$, to $4$ rather than scaling $4$ by the factor.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Parallel lines come from a scale factor applied to both coefficients, never from a difference.
