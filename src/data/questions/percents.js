      question: "In a chemistry lab, $6\\%$ of a sample's mass is sodium. Which of the following decimals is equivalent to $6\\%$?",
      choices: [
        // distractor: divides by 1,000
        { id: "A", text: "$0.006$" },
        { id: "B", text: "$0.06$" },

      ],
      correctAnswer: "B",
      hint: "A percent counts hundredths, so the decimal point moves two places to the left.",
      explanation: "**Choice B is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~10s):** $6\\% = \\frac{6}{100} = 0.06$.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: The word percent means per hundred, so $6\\%$ is the fraction $\\frac{6}{100}$.\nStep 2: Dividing $6$ by $100$ moves the decimal point two places to the left: $6. \\to 0.06$.\nStep 3: So $6\\% = 0.06$. Check by reversing: $0.06 \\times 100 = 6$, which is the original percent. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($0.006$): divides by $1{,}000$, moving the decimal point three places.\n* Choice C ($0.6$): moves the decimal point only one place, which is $60\\%$.\n* Choice D ($6$): drops the percent sign without dividing at all.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Converting a percent to a decimal is a single division by $100$; converting back is a single multiplication by $100$.",

      correctAnswer: "C",
      hint: "Multiply the decimal by $100$ and attach the percent sign.",
      explanation: "**Choice C is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~10s):** $0.045 \\times 100 = 4.5$, so the water content is $4.5\\%$.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: A decimal becomes a percent when it is multiplied by $100$.\nStep 2: $0.045 \\times 100 = 4.5$, which moves the decimal point two places to the right.\nStep 3: Attach the percent sign: $4.5\\%$. Check the size: $0.045$ is a bit less than $\\frac{1}{20} = 5\\%$, and $4.5\\%$ is a bit less than $5\\%$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($0.045\\%$): attaches a percent sign without multiplying, which is a hundred times too small.\n* Choice B ($0.45\\%$): moves the decimal point only one place.\n* Choice D ($45\\%$): moves the decimal point three places, multiplying by $1{,}000$.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Percent and decimal differ by exactly two decimal places — check the size of the answer against a familiar benchmark such as $5\\%$.",

Check with an equivalent fraction: $\\frac{7}{40} = \\frac{17.5}{100}$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($7\\%$): reports the numerator as the percent, ignoring the denominator.\n* Choice C ($40\\%$): reports the denominator as the percent.\n* Choice D ($175\\%$): multiplies the decimal by $1{,}000$ instead of $100$; a part of a whole cannot exceed $100\\%$.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** A fraction of a whole must land between $0\\%$ and $100\\%$ — that size check kills two distractors immediately.",

      question: "At a recycling center, $\\frac{7}{20}$ of the material collected is glass, $0.28$ of it is paper, and $12\\%$ of it is metal. The rest of the material collected is plastic. Which type of material makes up the greatest share of the material collected?",
      choices: [
        { id: "A", text: "Glass" },

      correctAnswer: "A",
      hint: "Put all three given shares into one common form before comparing, and remember the leftover has to be found.",
      explanation: "**Choice A is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~30s):** As percents the shares are $35$, $28$, $12$, and the leftover $25$; glass is largest.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Convert everything to percents. $\\frac{7}{20} = \\frac{35}{100} = 35\\%$ glass, and $0.28 = 28\\%$ paper. Metal is already $12\\%$.\nStep 2: The four shares total $100\\%$, so plastic is $100 - 35 - 28 - 12 = 25\\%$.\nStep 3: Comparing $35\\%$, $28\\%$, $12\\%$, and $25\\%$, the largest is glass. Check the sum: $35 + 28 + 12 + 25 = 100$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice B (Paper): reads $\\frac{7}{20}$ as $7\\%$ and compares only the three shares that are stated, where paper's $28\\%$ would be the largest.\n* Choice C (Metal): compares the raw numbers $\\frac{7}{20}$, $0.28$, and $12$ without converting, so $12$ looks biggest.\n* Choice D (Plastic): leaves glass out of the subtraction, computing $100 - 28 - 12 = 60$ for plastic.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** Comparisons across fractions, decimals, and percents are only safe after everything is in the same form — and a share described as the rest must be computed, not skipped.",

Then the number of hardcover books is $\\frac{3}{5}(5k) = 3k$.\nStep 2: The total number of books is $5k + 3k = 8k$, so the hardcover share of the total is $\\frac{3k}{8k} = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nStep 3: As a percent, $\\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 = 37.5\\%$, so $p = 37.5$. Check with $k = 10$: $50$ paperbacks and $30$ hardcovers out of $80$ books, and $\\frac{30}{80} = 37.5\\%$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice A ($25$): reports $\\frac{2}{8}$, the share by which the paperbacks outnumber the hardcovers, instead of the hardcover share.\n* Choice C ($60$): treats $\\frac{3}{5}$ itself as the share of the TOTAL, but it is the share of the paperbacks only.\n* Choice D ($62.5$): reports the paperback share $\\frac{5}{8}$ of the total rather than the hardcover share.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** When one group is described as a fraction of ANOTHER group, the total is the sum of the parts — never the denominator of the given fraction.",

      explanation: "**Choice A is correct.**\n\n**The Fast Way (~15s):** $0.45 \\times 340 = 153$.\n\n**The Full Solution:**\nStep 1: Finding a percent OF a quantity means multiplying, so write $45\\%$ as the decimal $0.45$.\nStep 2: Multiply: $0.45 \\times 340 = 153$.\nStep 3: So $153$ seats are in the balcony. Check the size: $45\\%$ is a little under half, and $153$ is a little under half of $340$. $\\checkmark$\n\n**Why the wrong answers are tempting:**\n* Choice B ($187$): computes $340 - 153$, the number of seats that are NOT in the balcony.\n* Choice C ($295$): subtracts $45$ from $340$, treating the percent as a count of seats.\n* Choice D ($1{,}530$): multiplies by $4.5$ instead of $0.45$, misplacing the decimal point.\n\n**Test Day Takeaway:** A percent of a total is always smaller than the total when the percent is under $100$ — a quick size check catches decimal-point slips.",
