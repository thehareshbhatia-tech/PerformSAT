/**
 * corpusLoader.js — memoized dynamic-import loaders for the question corpus
 * (Stage 2b of the bundle-split plan).
 *
 * The corpus (~9MB raw: math bank shards, the flattened R&W bank, all 36
 * practice-test bundles, topic question files) used to be statically welded
 * into the main chunk through App.jsx and two corpus-coupled services. Every
 * loader here wraps a webpack dynamic import() so each corpus slice ships as
 * its own named chunk, fetched on first use (or on idle via preloadCorpus).
 *
 * Memoization contract: each loader caches the import PROMISE at module
 * scope, so concurrent callers share one in-flight fetch, StrictMode's
 * double-invoke is free, and repeat calls are synchronous-resolving cache
 * hits. Never cache in component state — that re-fires per mount.
 *
 * When to use: any App.jsx handler (or main-chunk module) that needs bank
 * lookups, practice-test bundles, or the routing/try-similar services must
 * `await` the matching loader instead of importing the module statically.
 * Components that are already their own lazy chunks (PracticeBank,
 * StudyPlanDashboard, the practice shells) may keep their static imports —
 * the corpus lands in their chunk graph, not in main.
