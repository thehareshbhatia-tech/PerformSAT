Fix an acute angle of a right triangle and you've fixed the ratios of its sides, because every right triangle with that angle is a scaled copy of every other — and sine, cosine, and tangent simply name those ratios. In practice, the work rests less on the ratios themselves than on labeling the sides correctly: one acronym, **SOH-CAH-TOA**, plus one shortcut for the recurring $\\sin(x°) = \\cos(y°)$ question covers nearly all of it, with little calculator work involved.",
