/**
 * Pure validation/mapping for the AI-tutor "systemBlocks v2" protocol — no
 * Firebase or Anthropic SDK imports, so it is unit-testable with node --test
 * (same pattern as stripePolicy.ts / reengagementPolicy.ts).
 *
 * Why this exists: the tutor client used to concatenate volatile per-turn
 * content into one big `system` STRING, so the single `cache_control:
 * ephemeral` block never produced a cache hit (the prefix changed every turn).
 * The v2 protocol lets the client send a SMALL array of system blocks and mark
 * only the stable ones cacheable, so the persona prefix is actually reused
 * across turns while volatile framing stays uncached.
 *
 * Security note: the mapping here NEVER passes a client object through
 * untouched. It reads only `.text` and `.cache` and constructs the Anthropic
 * block objects itself, so a client cannot smuggle other keys (e.g. a
 * `cache_control` with an arbitrary TTL) into the upstream request.
